## A peaceful study platform.

This memorization flash card game rotates through your study material and eliminates the questions you are comfortable with, rotating your unanswered or incorrect cards back into the mix. 

### Technology

The logic is written in vanilla javascript and styling was made in SCSS. I used the Yeoman webapp builder to provide basic templates and for the built-in compiler. 

### Contributions
